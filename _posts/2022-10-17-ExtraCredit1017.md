### Why Engineering is important

- Engineering can be used in many fields of study, and the concepts of engineering can be used to solve problems to make a positive impact in the world
- Follows a logical thought process
- Engineering are useful in society

### Different streams of Engineering:

- Electronics
- Robotics
- Communication 
- Aeronautics
- Industrial
- Computer Science
- Mechanical
- Structural
- Civil Engineering

- User took communication engineering for her stream and also focused on computer science and electronics. After User graduated the user went to a job relating communication engineering which related to computer engineering (ARozn aand Qualcom).

### What is Qualcom doing:
i've heard QUALCOMM makes a lot of the mobile technoiogy and is working on 5g
qualcomm makes chips and wireless technology
mobile phone chips
Makes processors
Qualcomm creates services related to networking and wireless technology

User Worked on IOT Technollogies, and multiple different products.



Chose Engineering asa a factor of Father aalso being there. One of the girls entering STEM at a place. Chose Engineering because very  good at math aand waas also chose computers because it was very rare aand unique. 4 yeraas of engineering college dreaming about a hgaradware engineer designer. But in the end became a software engineer. Landed 1st job in a computer science company. Worked on 3d Engionerng  of a comp[any than started working as a software engineer.

What universities specialize in software engineering? In those universities, what are the majors that would help me learn the necessary skills and concepts to get a software developer job in tech app companies (Google, Amazon, Apple, Qualcomm)? What should I do in high school to increase my chances to get admitted into them
UC San Diego has a great engineering school. Working in virtual reality company which is associated with google, all this stuff is also part of hardware. A lot of companies gave a combination of software and hardware engineers. Taking a lot of AP courses and making sure that GPA is very high. Also joining courses and robotics to show interest in engineering. Take advantage of any programs which can help you for engineering`.

Biggest Challenges?
Work=Life Balance was very Hard. User 1 kept talking about balancing mother life with work lif
