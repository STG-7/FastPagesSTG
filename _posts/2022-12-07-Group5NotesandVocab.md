# 3.9 Algorithms and 3.11 3.11 Binary and Sequential Search

### Essential Knowledge

**There are numerous methods to write algorithms and still have them complete the same goals. Similar algorithms can have distinct side effects or outcomes. You can write some conditional statements as equivalent Boolean expressions. You can write some Boolean expressions as equivalent conditional statements. The same issue can be resolved using several algorithms that can be created or used. Ideas can be turned into algorithms, current algorithms can be combined with new ones, or old algorithms can be changed. Understanding current algorithms can be useful when creating new ones.**

Several algorithms in use now include: 
- figuring out the highest or lowest value shared by two or more numbers
- calculating the average or sum of multiple integers
- determining whether or not an integer is evenly divisbile by another
- figuring out a robot's route 
- reducing development time
- reduce testing
- simplifying the identification of errors

### Big Ideas and Vocab

**Small changes/mistakes can have a big impact on the result.**
**There is often more than one way to achieve the same result.**

Algorithm: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer.
Sequential Search (Inefficient search): compare each number to the number you want to find until you get to the number you want to find
Binary Search (Efficient search): repeats the process of finding a median and evaluating
Boolean Expressions: expression that evaluates to either true or false
Truth Tables: displays the logical operations on input signals in a table format, identifies all possible input combinations and the output for each
