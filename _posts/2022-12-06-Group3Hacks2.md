# Question 7

Topic: Base 0 Indexing

What It is: Sequence demarcated with an index starting from 0

Further Research:
Base 0 indexing  is a way of numbering in which the initial element of a sequence is assigned the index 0, rather than the index 1 as is typical in everyday non-mathematical or non-programming circumstances. Zero-based array indexing is a way of numbering the items in an array such that the first item of it has an index of 0, whereas a one-based array indexed array has its first item indexed as 1.


# Question 10

Topic: For Loops, While Loops

What It Is: 2, both for Loops


# Reflection

I improved my comprehension of a wide range of ideas during these portions. I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the three primary types of loops (for, while, and recursive), as well as the significance of iterations and lists. I can automate some code snippets more effectively by learning more about list capabilities like the append and pop options rather than by layering similar code to do the same purpose in a more time-consuming way.
