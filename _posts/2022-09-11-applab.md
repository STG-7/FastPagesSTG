### AppLab Planning/Blogging 

Goals:
- 3 Question quiz on Python syntax
- Final score and percentage is outputted at the end
- Explanations for right and wrong answers in the quiz
- Design should look neat and well connected


Purpose: The purpose of this program is to test the userâ€™s understanding in Python syntax.

Functionality:  This program consists of 15 different screens and tests users on 3 different questions relating to Python. It starts with a home screen that allows users to click a button that takes them to the first question and different answer options. Each of those options when clicked on will take the user  to a seperate screen that tells whether the answer is correct/incorrect and gives an explanation. On the bottom of these screens are a button that can take you to next question. After the final question is answered there will also be a button on the bottom of the "explanation" screens that will take you to the final page. This page outputs which questions you got correct and the final percenage.


Testing: I tested this quiz multiple times, both in the process of creating the quiz and even after I fully programmed it. For the first call, I made it so that the user got a specific question wrong and got the other two correct, therefore displaying a final score of 2 out of 3. For the second call, I made it so that the user got two questions wrong and one correct, giving a final score of 1 out of 3.
