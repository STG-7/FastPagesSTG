Main Questions:

How to know what side of engineering you want to pursue? (software, hardware, etc)
Keep a growth mindset, start with knowing interest and love. It may feel hard to know exactly what you want to do, and get exposure in different fields and career paths.

What universities specialize in software engineering? In those universities, what are the majors that would help me learn the necessary skills and concepts to get a software developer job in tech app companies (Google, Amazon, Apple, Qualcomm)? What should I do in high school to increase my chances to get admitted into them
UC San Diego has a great engineering school. Working in virtual reality company which is associated with google, all this stuff is also part of hardware. A lot of companies gave a combination of software and hardware engineers. Taking a lot of AP courses and making sure that GPA is very high. Also joining courses and robotics to show interest in engineering. Take advantage of any programs which can help you for engineering`.

Biggest Challenges?
Work=Life Balance was very Hard. User 1 kept talking about balancing mother life with work lif
