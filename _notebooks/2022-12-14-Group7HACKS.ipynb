    "I gained knowledge about software libraries, current code segments' uses, APIs, and the value of documentation for these APIs and software libraries from this session. In order to create programs more quickly, I found that it is quite helpful to reuse existing procedures in code. In addition, it's crucial to provide the right documentation for these operations, outlining what each step does and what the program is meant to achieve. I also gained additional knowledge about the Python package \"random,\" which is frequently utilized. It is really cool that it can function as both a random number generator and a number shuffler."
