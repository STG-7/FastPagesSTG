    "1; in a store the number of apples can change from coustomers taking them and the store restocking them. This means that there's addition and subtraction is going on, which tells us the the variable type is an integer. Which is why I chose 1 as my answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3; the variable type must be boolean because we're looking for a True or False output this leaves choices 2 and 3 but 3 is chosen since \"isCold\" is more specific than \"weather\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1; the variable type is string since ID numbers can't be added or subracted by a value, leaving 1 as the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2; the variable is too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "1; only booleans have the ablity to store a variable as true or false.\n",
