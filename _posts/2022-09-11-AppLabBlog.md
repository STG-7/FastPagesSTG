### AppLab Planning/Blogging 

Planning:
- 3 Question quiz on Python syntax
- Final score and percentage is outputted at the end
- Design should look neat and well connected

Blogging:
At first I used the code tab to implement buttons and position of the bottom and then use on-event code for each of those buttons. After the first set of questions I realized that this is not efficient and started using the design tab to place buttons and other features on the screens. From there I used the code tab and coded in javascript to use these buttons and labels. 



### AppLab Creation

[Quiz-AppLab](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/yrwPro-CrNcHUNN8dMl2ptFtyLiGMMKfnJsrWg_sqjs)

Extra features in the program:
- Explanations for right and wrong answers for every question in the quiz
- Final Percentage and accuracy of each question is posted at the end
- Use of "if" conditional statements and JavaScript code to further enhance the App


### Relating AppLab to College Board Performance Task

Quiz did not have Data Abstraction, Managing Complexity, Procedural Abstraction, and Algorithm Implementation

Purpose: The purpose of this program is to test the userâ€™s understanding in Python syntax.

Functionality:  This program consists of 15 different screens and tests users on 3 different questions relating to Python. It starts with a home screen that allows users to click a button that takes them to the first question and different answer options. Each of those options when clicked on will take the user  to a seperate screen that tells whether the answer is correct/incorrect and gives an explanation. On the bottom of these screens are a button that can take you to next question. After the final question is answered there will also be a button on the bottom of the "explanation" screens that will take you to the final page. This page outputs which questions you got correct and the final percenage.

Testing: I tested this quiz multiple times, both in the process of creating the quiz and even after I fully programmed it. I tested every screen's output and tested the validity of the final percentage in the last screen.
