# Scrum Roles

Our group decided on the following roles:

- Shaurya Goel: Scrum Master
- Evan Apari: DevOps
- Alex Lu: Backend
- Haseeb Beg and Tirth Thakar: Frontend

As scrum master, I will make sure my team is always on task and that we have our review tickets ready on time.Also I will talk on the behalf of my team to Mr. Mortensen so that all questions are answered and that the content is understood. 

Alex will be the backend programmer in our group as he is very advanced in object oriented programming. I will also be able to help Alex Lu out as I have understanding in python and other OOP languages.

Tirth and Haseeb will collaborate together as frontend programmers. They have already started collaborating and using frontened tools on our final project and I can see this working out in the near future.

Evan will be our DevOps manager, he did well with the AWS deployment and I can see him being productive in the future.
