Some of the aulumini graduated to UCs | Most of them are majoring or have some sort of knowledge and background in Computer Science | . Biggest Challenges in Computer Science . Staying motivated You may get demotivated because of problems and setbacks during the learning process | You also may get demotivated because of people being ahead of you | . | Getting started, coding is very difficult | . . General Tips in Computer Science . Focus on your own path | Ignore clashing egos with colleagues and peers | Have a better mindset to learn instead of just trying to get stuff down (Taking shortcuts does not help!) | Logic/Algorithmic problemsolving is more important than knowledge of syntax | Logical thinking background helped Alumini with Coding and solving problems | . Group Based Work in College . There are a lot of group based assignments in college | Managing your group is very important to your success | Some of the alumini got used for doing too much group work, be mindful on how you split your work amongst colleagues and peers | . Are there any PBL scenarios in college computer science classes? . In college there are 2 of them, 1 in senior year | In college there are some project based learning classes and some theory based classes | There are a lot of PBL exams which are fixed for computer science courses | . Applying for Computer Science even if you are not majoring in it . Computer science can be used for optimization in other fields Mechanical Engineering | Cognitive Science | Aerospace | 3D Printing | Statistics (Code in R) | . | Computer science can also help with high level math | Programming is in almost every field. | . Internships . Getting internships and talking to professors will help get better jobs | . Tips for getting internships: . Have an outstanding resume that seperates you from everyone else Linkedin, Portfolio websites | . | Know when to apply Dates to apply, deadlines, etc. | . | Networking other people/engineers that are currently in the job | . | . Alumini personal experience in Internships: . Alumuni did Internships in Northrop Grumman | Alumini did internships in a company doing APIs and web development | . . Additonal Information on Internships and Future Jobs . Doing 2 or 3 personal projects will help out with applying for internships and jobs | Alumini did a lot of work in data application | Alumini joined a club called Trident A in UCSD | .",
